# Often, when dealing with iterators, we also get a need to keep a count of iterations. Python eases the programmersâ€™ task by providing a built-in function enumerate() for this task.
# Time Complexity: O(n)
#
# Space Complexity: O(n)
# Where as brute force with two loops it will take time complexity to O(n^2)
